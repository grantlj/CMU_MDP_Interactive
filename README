Update: 01/16/2017, Add interactive training and tesing module based on MDP framework.

MDP_Interactive
Author: Jiang Liu, 12/20/2016
Compatible to compile and run with Python 2.7 (Anaconda 64-bit)[1], PyQT v4.11[2] and OpenCV 3.1 with python support[3] in 64-bit Windows. Other platforms like Linux and MacOS could be easily supported with little modification.

92-2_demo: an instance of the video folder prepared for user to annotate, including Images/ (raw video frames named with %06d.jpg), model/ (a null folder to store updated tracker), output/ (the tracking result after each annotation iteration, a output_iteration_1.txt is required as the input for first iteration, we use Online MDP[4] to generate the initial result), and det.txt (bounding box detections for each frame, the file format could be refered from [5]).

MDP_Labeler: The code for the interactive labelling tool for multi-object tracking datasets.

QT_Player: a concise version of the video player part used in MDP_Labeler.
